 * Expected data sample:
 * {
 *   comments: [
 *     {
 *       id: "1",
 *       nickname: "user123",
 *       text: "This is a top-level comment",
 *       date: "2024-01-15",
 *       replies: [
 *         {
 *           id: "2",
 *           nickname: "replier456",
 *           text: "This is a nested reply",
 *           date: "2024-01-16",
 *           replies: []
 *         }
 *       ]
 *     }
 *   ]
 * }
 *
 * Step 1: Create a RedditComment component that renders a single comment
 * - Render an <article> with css.comment and flex.padding16
 * - <header> with flex.flexRowBetween: <strong> for nickname, <time> for date
 * - <p> for comment text with padding classes
 *
 * Step 2: Handle nested replies recursively
 * - If comment.replies.length > 0, render a <details>/<summary> toggle
 * - Inside <details>, render a <ul> with each reply as a <li>
 * - Recursively render <RedditComment> for each reply
 *
 * Step 3: Create RedditThreadComponent that maps over top-level comments
 * - Wrap in a container div with css.container and flex.wh100
 * - Map over comments array, rendering <RedditComment> for each

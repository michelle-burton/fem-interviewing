# Prepare for UI Interview V2

This is a **Frontend Masters - Prepare for UI Interview V2** supporting repo. Here you will find problems that we solve together on the course along with additional materials and reference solutions for DOM API Based / React based challenges.

## 🎓 Course Structure

The course is divided into multiple sections, and with each section, we will gradually increase the difficulty.

### 1. Classic JavaScript Problems

This section serves as a warm-up. We will start with short (5–10 minute) problems that provide an overview of common JavaScript utilities and patterns frequently tested in interviews.

### 2. Practical UI Problems

Here, we will get our hands dirty and implement real UI patterns, components, and parts of applications.
We will actively use **HTML**, **CSS**, **TypeScript**, and **React**.

Each problem will have:

- A vanilla (framework-free) solution
- A React-based solution

During the workshop, we will intentionally switch between vanilla JavaScript and React to strengthen both skill sets.
I strongly advise you to **disable** all AI assistance and practice the problems on your own. The goal of this section is to acquire all the necessary skills to solve UI component problems using both React and Vanilla approaches.

### 3. TypeScript Problems

Finally, we will cover essential TypeScript type-level programming—the kind often asked in senior and staff-level frontend interviews. This is often called "type programming". You can even code the Doom game in TypeScript types! But, luckily for us, we won't get that deep :)

## 🧠 Problem Difficulty

The problems in this workshop are intentionally **slightly** harder than real interview questions.
The idea is simple: **If you train on harder problems, real interviews will feel calmer and more manageable.**

Problems are grouped into the following difficulty levels:

### 🧘 Warm-up

- Very basic problems that you should solve quickly.
- **Expected time**: 2–4 minutes.

### 🟢 Easy

- Small 5–10 minute problems.
- Some companies may give 3–4 easy problems in a 45-minute screening interview.

### 🟡 Medium

- 15–20 minute problems.
- The majority of frontend interview questions fall into this category.

### 🔴 Hard

- 45+ minute problems that require practice and familiarity with specific browser APIs.
- During the workshop, we will aim to solve them in 20–25 minutes to save time, but in real interviews, you would typically spend 45–60 minutes.
- **Examples**:
  - Observer APIs
  - Drag & Drop
  - Event handling

### 🚀 Extreme

- 1–2 hour end-to-end problems.
- These usually involve building a minimal version of a real product feature from scratch.
- You may be provided with a mock server or API, and the focus shifts heavily toward architecture and structure.
- **Examples**:
  - Figma-like canvas
  - Google Sheets–style grid
  - To-do application
  - Chat application (e.g., ChatGPT-like UI)

### 3. TypeScript Challenges

TypeScript type challenges are **interleaved throughout the course** alongside the JavaScript and Component problems. After every 2 core problems, you'll find 2 TypeScript type challenges to practice type-level programming. Look for folders with the `-challenge-` suffix in `src/problems/` (e.g., `03-tuple-length-challenge-1`).

The challenges cover topics including: Basics, Mapped Types, Conditional Types, Infer, Template Literals, Recursive Types, Distributive Conditionals, Advanced Patterns, and Expert Techniques.

## 🙏 Credits

Some problems in this course are inspired by or adapted from the following open-source resources:

- **[BFE.dev](https://bfe.dev/)** — A platform for frontend interview preparation with a great collection of JavaScript and UI coding challenges.
- **[type-challenges](https://github.com/type-challenges/type-challenges)** — A collection of TypeScript type challenges by Anthony Fu. Our TypeScript challenges are based on problems from this repository.
